"""Security audit logging middleware.

This module provides middleware to log security-relevant events such as:
- Successful and failed authentication attempts
- Authorization failures (403 errors)
- Suspicious request patterns
- CSRF validation failures

Audit logs are written to a separate logger channel for security analysis
and compliance requirements.

GDPR Compliance:
- Security audit logs retain full IP addresses (legitimate interest for security)
- Non-security logs should use anonymised IPs via anonymise_ip()
- Recommended retention: 90 days for security logs, 30 days for general logs

"""Processing restriction service for GDPR Article 18 compliance.

This module implements the Right to Restriction of Processing (Article 18)
by providing functionality for users to restrict how their data is processed.

GDPR Requirements (Article 18):
- Users can restrict processing when contesting data accuracy
- Users can restrict processing instead of erasure
- Users can restrict processing when processing is unlawful
- Users can restrict processing when data needed for legal claims

When processing is restricted:
- Data is stored but not processed (except storage)
- User can still authenticate (essential processing)
- Data not used for analytics or marketing
- Data not shared with third parties
- Security logging continues (legal obligation)

Example:
    >>> ProcessingRestrictionService.restrict_processing(user, "Contesting accuracy")
    >>> is_restricted = ProcessingRestrictionService.is_restricted(user)
    >>> ProcessingRestrictionService.lift_restriction(user)

    Handles the restriction and lifting of data processing for users.
    When restricted, user data should only be stored, not processed

    Processing Restrictions Applied:
    - No analytics or tracking
    - No marketing communications
    - No data sharing with third parties
    - No automated decision-making
    - Essential authentication still allowed
    - Security logging still allowed (legal obligation)

    Security Features:
    - All restriction changes are audit logged
    - Restriction reason is recorded
    - Timestamps track when restriction was applied/lifted
